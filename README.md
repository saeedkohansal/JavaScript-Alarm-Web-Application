Hello Developers I hope you have a wonderful day welcome to gilgeekify, my name is Saeed Kohansal, and in this video, I will create an alarm web application with sound notification from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript, This is a client-side web application, I'm using localStorage from HTML Web Storage API to save my data inside the browser, The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date so we have all data we need in the user's browser, I will create three sections for my web application, an option to set the alarm, an option to see the active alarm, and an option to display a full-screen alarm notification and play sound automatically...
